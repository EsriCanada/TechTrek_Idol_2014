## Instructions:
These are the instructions for sharing your work on GitHub. Even if you're not coding, you should create a repo here and minimally fill out a ReadMe.md [This link will show you how to create cool markdown](http://markdownlivepreview.com).  Designate someone on your team to create a repo for your project; the general flow will be to fork the "TechTrek_Idol_2014" repo to your own account, clone it in desktop, commit and sync often.  

If you are the designated person on your team, follow these steps to get ready:

* Creat a GitHub account
* Email me, Matt English, or Amr Eldib your GitHub username and we will add it to the Esri Canada Team
* [Download Windows client](https://windows.github.com), or 
* [Download Mac client](https://mac.github.com)
* Open your Git client app, and set the "Clone Path" to a directory of your choice
* Fork your own copy (button in upper right of this page) of this repo to your own account
* Click the "Clone in Desktop" button, you'll see a clone of this forked repo in your Git client app
* Open up the directory on your computer where you set the clone path in the above step, you'll see a folder named "TechTrek_Idol_2014"
* Create a directory underneath this one with your team name and project - this is what will appear on GitHub
* Underneath this newly-created directory create a file called README.md, put the name of your team in there (you'll edit this over time and add more content)
* Add your project files, do an initial commit of only the files you want to share on GitHubusing your Git client
* Click the "Sync" button in your Git client
* Code away, add new files etc, Commit and Sync often

**Please do not submit any pull requests until we have all teams in place and repos created.** I have created a "MattEnglishSampleProject" which contains a WebApp Builder widget to demonstrate the end result of a merged pull request. 


All repos need to be merged into this repo by **9am EDT Oct 1, 2014**. Prizes will be awarded October 30, 2014.


Happy Hacking, Matt (call me if you're lost)
