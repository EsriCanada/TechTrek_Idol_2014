Tech Trek Idol 2014
==================

These are the instructions for sharing your work on GitHub. You should share your code here, and minimally you need to fill our your ReadMe.md to at least show a presence on GitHub.  Designate someone on your team to create a repo for your project. If you are that designated person, follow these steps:

* Creat a GitHub account
* Email Matt English your GitHub username and he will add it to the Esri Canada Team
* [Download Windows client](https://windows.github.com), or 
* [Download Mac client](https://mac.github.com)
* Open your Git client app, and set the "Clone Path" to a directory of your choice
* Fork your own copy (button in upper right of this page) of this repo to your own account
* Click the "Clone in Desktop" button, you'll see a clone of this forked repo in your Git client app
* Open up the directory on your computer where you set the clone path in the above step, you'll see a folder named "TechTrek_Idol_2014"
* Create a directory underneath this one with your team name and project - this is what will appear on GitHub
* Add your files, do an initial commit of the files using your Git client
* Click the "Sync" button in your Git client
* Code away, add new files etc, Commit and Sync
* 

Please do not submit any pull requests until we have all teams in place and repos created. Happy Hacking, Matt
