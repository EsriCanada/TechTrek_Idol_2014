Tech Trek Idol 2014
==================

These are the instructions for sharing your work on GitHub. Even if you're not coding, you should create a repo here and minimally fill out a ReadMe.md with a creative description of your project. This will give everyone a presence on GitHub plus we'll know you have a team.  Designate someone on your team to create a repo for your project. The general flow will be to fork the "TechTrek_Idol_2014" repo to your own account, clone it in desktop, commit and sync often.  

If you are the designated person on your team, follow these steps to get ready:

* Creat a GitHub account
* Email me, Matt English, your GitHub username and I will add it to the Esri Canada Team
* [Download Windows client](https://windows.github.com), or 
* [Download Mac client](https://mac.github.com)
* Open your Git client app, and set the "Clone Path" to a directory of your choice
* Fork your own copy (button in upper right of this page) of this repo to your own account
* Click the "Clone in Desktop" button, you'll see a clone of this forked repo in your Git client app
* Open up the directory on your computer where you set the clone path in the above step, you'll see a folder named "TechTrek_Idol_2014"
* Create a directory underneath this one with your team name and project - this is what will appear on GitHub
* Add your files, do an initial commit of only the files you want to share using your Git client
* Click the "Sync" button in your Git client
* Code away, add new files etc, Commit and Sync often

**Please do not submit any pull requests until we have all teams in place and repos created.** I have created a "MattEnglishSampleProject" which contains a WebApp Builder widget to demonstrate the end result of a merged pull request. 


All repos need to be merged into this repo by September 15, 2014. Prizes will be awarded September 30, 2014.


Happy Hacking, Matt (call me if you're lost)
