Project: CBCNewsFeedMap

A JSAPI map application which plots CBC News Feeds on a global web map and displays the news stories in a way!

We took a number of CBC news feeds http://www.cbc.ca/rss/

We then used a site that georeferences them by finding the first referenced name to a location http://www.geonames.org/

The newly created GeoRSS feeds are then plotted on an ArcGIS Online web map
