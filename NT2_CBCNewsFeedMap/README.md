### Project: CBCNewsFeedMap

####A JSAPI map application which plots CBC News Feeds on a global web map and displays the news stories in a way!

####We took a number of [CBC news feeds](http://www.cbc.ca/rss/)

####We then used a site called [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) that georeferences them by finding the first referenced name to a location. 

####The newly created GeoRSS feeds are then plotted on an ArcGIS Online web map.

**Be sure to switch to the four different news feeds by clicking on the
*"Show Next News Feed"* button**

* **1st Feed - World News**
* **2nd Feed - Top Stories**
* **3rd Feed - Canada News**
* **4th Feed - Sports**

**Biggest challenge with this app was in the JavaScript code. We needed to destroy each of the widgets and re-create them in the DOM as as user switches between each news feed.**



##Why our app is Cool:
####This simple application demonstrates the power of the ArcGIS Platform and how GIS is for everyone. Plotting world events onto a map can give a better perspective into our world and how it functions. If you ever read a news story and wondered exactly where the story occurred or where the story originated in relation to a surrounding area that may be important to you, then this app was built especially for you!
