This "oil painting" of our green roof is also generated by the same proxy that powers the above sample apps.

## Description

AForge.NET is an open source .NET library for image processing.  We used this in a simple ASP.NET application to create a proxy service that transforms dynamic and static images on the fly.  Instead of exposing complex objects in the API, we wrapped common image processing tools in a set of static functions.  As a result, resulting functions can be chained in a more "compositional" manner.  This also made it relatively easy to expose the functions as a query string parameter of the URL without having to invent complex domain language rules.

Why is this cool?  It's scalable.  It puts no extra burden (both in terms of performance and maintainability) on the client or the server.  Future research ideas include edge detection, vectorization ("snap to raster edges"), multiple raster processing, true stereo anaglyph implementation, "map algebra" syntactic abstraction, etc.
