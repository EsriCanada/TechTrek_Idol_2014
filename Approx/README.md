This "oil painting" of our green roof is also generated by the same proxy that powers the above sample apps.

## Description

AForge.NET is an open source .NET library for image processing.  We used this in a simple ASP.NET application to create a proxy service that transforms dynamic and static images on the fly.  Instead of exposing complex objects in the API, we wrapped common image processing tools in a set of static functions.  As a result, resulting functions can be chained in a more "compositional" manner.  This also made it relatively easy to expose the functions as a query string parameter of the URL without having to invent complex domain language rules.
