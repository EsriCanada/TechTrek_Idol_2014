# PURPOSE OF APPLICATION: #
The SPORE (Social Profiling for Optimization in Real-Estate) application has been developed to maximize the search efforts of those looking for real-estate in new areas they are not familiar with.  When moving outside the current city/province of residence, the ability to allocate time in one’s search is limited.  You cannot drive hours, or fly across the country every weekend to go house hunting.  So for the time spent in that city or province needs to be maximized in looking at the areas that best fit the social characteristics of the current neighbourhood that you live (or aspire to reside).

The application allows users to enter the location of  their current residence and, through the use of the Environics Analytics demographics and social profiling data, enables the user to find similar neighbourhoods in the city/province to which they are moving.

----------

# APPLICATION WORKFLOW: #
1. The user is asked to put in the Postal Code of their current residence (this can also be used as an area they may have interest in and would like to find others of similar characteristics).
1. Based on the Dissemination Area in which that Postal Code resides, the search area will issue a social profile or PrizmC2© cluster (social profiles look at the demographics and behavioral characteristics of an area).
1. The user will then be able to select a destination, or area in which they would like look at.  The user can type in a Postal Code or city name and request a buffer around that point
1. This will call back and display all the areas in which the social profiles or PrizmC2© clusters that either match the same cluster or group in the area the user currently resides
1. The user  can then look at real-estate that is within the defined areas, as well further demographics of the area, including income, ethnicity, occupation, education, and marital status, among others.

# PROPOSITION VALUE: #
This application offers benefits to the end user in the form of time and cost.  When moving to a new province, there is the element of the unknown.  What areas are good and which are bad? Does this area correlate with my social lifestyle? The application can identify areas that are of similar socio-economic standing, thereby increasing the knowledge of which areas should be concentrated on in the property search. This reduces the amount of time needed to conduct a search for a new home. When moving within the same city, one has time to go out and view properties on the evenings and weekends. When moving to another province, this is not an option.  Planning, cost, travel and time off are required to conduct an out-of-province property search. This application allows users to simplify the planning process, giving the user the ability find target areas, and concentrate their time to the areas that are most suited to them.

This type of application has a go-to-market capability within the real-estate sector (provided [Environics Analytics](http://www.environicsanalytics.ca/ "Environics Analytics") provisions rights to using the [PrizmC2©](http://www.environicsanalytics.ca/data/segmentation/prizmc2 "PrizmC2") content). The application can be used by both real-estate websites for house hunters who are actively looking for real-estate, while providing agents the ability to streamline their time in providing the optimal locations in which to take their clients when searching for a new residence.
