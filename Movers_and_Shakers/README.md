# PURPOSE OF APPLICATION: #
People frequently need to purchase a home in an unfamiliar city. They do their house-hunting from a distance (on-line) and have little or no opportunity to get a feel for the city’s different neighbourhoods. Yet, in this situation, the neighbourhood is the home-buyers’ first concern; they are usually looking for something similar to the place where they currently live. Online real estate listings provide some neighbourhood information, but to get that information, house-hunters have to mine the listings house by house. The SPORE (Social Profiling for Optimization in Real Estate) application saves house-hunters time and money by narrowing down real estate listings to those in comparable neighbourhoods. SPORE combines Environics Analytics demographic and social profiling data with current real estate listings to show distance house-hunters what they are *really* looking for—a place to call home.

# APPLICATION WORKFLOW: #
1.	Users enter a postal code from a neighbourhood they are familiar with or that is of the type they are looking for in the unfamiliar city. 
2.	Based on the dissemination area of the selected postal code, the application returns a social profile or social cluster (the  demographic and behavioral characteristics of an area) for that neighbourhood. 
3.	Users select the destination city of their choice, specifying the area (a distance limit from that city) in which to search.
4.	The application returns a number of neighbourhoods that match either the specific social profile or the social cluster of the initial neighbourhood users selected.
5.	Users have the option to display real estate listings that fall within or near the areas that match their chosen social cluster, or areas characterized by a broader group of similar social clusters.
6.	Users can then browse through the returned listings to select a home that is suitable.

# PROPOSITION VALUE: #
The primary benefits of SPORE are the savings in time and cost. Specifically, using SPORE means

- Less time spent reviewing listings that do not meet the house-hunter’s neighbourhood  criteria
- Less time and money spent in travel to the unfamiliar city to view listings and investigate neighbourhoods
- An immediate knowledge of an otherwise unfamiliar neighbourhood 

SPORE has a go-to-market capability within the real-estate sector as well.  Individual purchasing agents can save a lot of time by immediately narrowing down their faraway buyers’ real estate options to homes in neighbourhoods the buyer will like. This can be done without (often impossible) “getting to know you” time; instead, it just takes the entry of a known and desirable postal code and a few clicks of a button. The application can also be used by real-estate agency websites, provided [Environics Analytics](http://www.environicsanalytics.ca) provisions rights to using the [PrizmC2](http://http://www.environicsanalytics.ca/data/segmentation/prizmc2)© content.

#WHY OUR APPLICATION: #
1.	From a development stand-point, our solution is built on our core ArcGIS Online platform.  We are also integrating content through one of Esri Canada’s premier partners, showing diversity and collaboration with third-party data in execution of the solution.  
2.	The development of the application, while complex behind the covers, offer simplicity in its operation and execution, bringing to users with limited knowledge and understanding of GIS technologies an easy-to-use application that delivers.
3.	What does SPORE deliver? An immediate solution to the anxiety that most plagues home-buyers: Is this a good place to live?  It lightens their investment of time and money and gets them to their new home more securely and quickly.

#WHAT'S COOL FOR DEVELOPERS: #
1.	The SPORE project has taken a minimalist approach to create a module that is easily plugged into the default Esri [Basic Viewer Template](https://github.com/Esri/Viewer) that users of ArcGIS Online will be familiar with.  A [fork of this template](https://github.com/mgleahy/Viewer) on GitHub adds the ability to plug-in custom widgets using the same toolbar/panel layout.  This enhanced viewer template is used as the framework to present the SPORE module.
2.	More to come...
