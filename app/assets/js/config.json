Decide whether you want to go listen to an up-and-coming band at the local pub, cheer on your favourite team, take in a show, or join in the fun at a community festival...</p><h3>reac.TOR puts <span class='font-red'>you in control</span></h3><p>Every day, there are dozens of different events across the city. reac.TOR's filters allow you to choose the <b>date</b>, the <b>price</b>, and the <b>type of event</b> so you only see the events you want to see. You can also filter the events displayed on the map by <b>source</b>.</p><h3>reac.TOR is <span class='font-red'>responsive</span></h3><p>Designed for mobile devices, event clustering keeps the map from getting too cluttered at any scale and at any screen size. Simply click on a cluster to break it into smaller clusters or individual events. Colour-coded map markers help you quickly spot the events you're most interested in.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>When you open reac.TOR, you'll automatically see all the events happening in Toronto for that given day. Click on an <b>event marker</b> to see essential information - what, when, where - about a particular event.  If you're intrigued, click <b>more info</b> to open an expanded popup with event details.</p><p>Click the <b><i class='fa fa-bars'></i> menu</b> button in the top-left corner, and you'll see a list of filters to help you narrow down what's displayed on the map to only <b>what/when/where</b> you're interested in.</p><p>Use the <b>neighbourhood selector</b> to zoom to an area of your choice, or click the <b><i class='fa fa-map-marker'></i> geolocator</b> (underneath the zoom controls) to find exactly where you are on the map.  If all else fails, click the <b><i class='fa fa-search'></i> magnifying glass</b> in the top-right corner to search and zoom to an address on the map.</p><h3>Why go through the trouble of sorting through countless events yourself when you don't have to?</h3><h3>Don't be proactive - get <span class='font-red'>reactive</span>!</h3>"
