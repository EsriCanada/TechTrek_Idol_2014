## Description
This app highlights the Grant & Gregotski family vacation to Charleston Lake Provincial Park from July 6-9, 2014. This is the sixth annual vacation of the Grant & Gregotski families and the second time the trip was made to Charleston Lake.

## Why this app is cool
1. It has a warm and toasty campfire to start the story (turn your speakers on to really get into the experience)
2. It uses the new [Story Map Journal App] (http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-journal/) that was showcased at the 2014 Esri User Conference.
3. The basemap features the latest contributions to the Esri Canada Community Maps Program from [Leeds Grenville] (http://www.leedsgrenville.com/en/).
4. It brings together data from a variety of sources to tell the story including: ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS for Server, Facebook, Dropbox and Ontario Parks.
