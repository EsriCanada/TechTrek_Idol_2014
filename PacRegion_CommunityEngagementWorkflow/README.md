Second submission from pac region pro services is an application for community consultation or citizen outreach based on core technology without development or 3rd party application. The idea here is to provide a simple, yet effective and efficient workflow example for GIS Coordinators and Planners to stand up a community engagement application without the requirement to buy new technology eg PlaceSpeak: https://www.placespeak.com/

The application was built using ArcGIS Online, Geoforms, Briefing Books, and Operations Dashboard, in a matter of hours, not days.

 * The Briefing Book-based application is for public consultation
 * The Operations Dashboard is for internal staff to view more detailed metrics including personal contact information.
 
 Here is the link to the app: http://65.52.115.204/BriefingBook/?bookId=8eb7753e16a84c94a220983d76544cb6
 
 The Application is "shared" to public, but may require login:
 contact nenge@esri.ca to get the login use to create the application.
