##### Summary

The stage is set - the teams have been decided - it’s too big to miss!  Rugby World Cup 2015 is quickly approaching, and The Prairies Professional Services team (team SMAPS) has captured all of the “must attend events”.  Using Esri’s Map Journal, team SMAPS has made it possible to explore everything Rugby on a map. 

From learning about the venues, or picking your favorite team, this journal provides one tool to plan how you will partake in the action.  Check out the trophy tour and the 15 stops it will take between May 2014 and June 2015.  Want to be closer to the action?  Check out the Local Perspective Application and plan a place to stay or where you can have your favorite pint while watching your favorite team!  Still not close enough?  Enter an address and find the closest match to attend in person – it’s all here, in the 2015 Rugby World Cup Map Journal.

##### Why is our application cool?

* Out of the box apart from a tiny section of javascript code in the Local Perspective Application.
* Integrates ArcGIS web apps within web apps.
* We were thinking ahead.
* Promoting our national teams.
* Highlights how Esri is better than Google:

##### Technology

*Story Map Journal*: You can combine narrative text with maps and other embedded content. A Map Journal contains entries, or sections, that users simply scroll through. Each section in a Story Map Journal has an associated map, image, video, web page or web application. Clicking on each stadium button on the left of our Story Map Journal will automatically zoom the section’s map to that particular stadium location and display points of interest and places to stay in the surrounding area.

*ArcGIS Online* (web maps & apps): Story Map Journal, Local Perspective and Story Map Tour

*Social Media*: Facebook, Youtube, Fotor (image editing)

##### Things we’ve noticed while working with these templates (OOTB):

* When you have a monitor attached to your laptop the Story Map Tour Web Application will display like this in our Story Map Journal Web Application:

* However if you do not have a monitor attached it will display like this:

* If you add images into the side panel of the Story Map Journal and decide to delete them to change to a different image, the html code can become corrupted with redundant image container tags and in turn url links from this section down stop working and entire sections blacken out:
