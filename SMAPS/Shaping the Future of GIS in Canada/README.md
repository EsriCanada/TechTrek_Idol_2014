##### Summary

As part of the Tech Trek Idol contest, the Prairies Professional Services team (team SMAPS) set-out to explore geomentoring, and to better understand the number and location of GIS Day events across Canada over time.  The SMAPS team had optimistically expected to see exponential growth in the number of GIS Day events in Canada since 1999.  However, our findings illustrated the number of host events since 1999 to 2013 has not changed significantly.  In fact, the only significant change was a decline in host events shortly after 1999 and up to 2007.

With the recent resurgence in GIS Day participation over the past 6 years, team SMAPS wanted to explore opportunities for ensuring this trend continues.  Using the Esri Canada Briefing Book, team SMAPS uses maps and media to share our findings and to highlight opportunities for **“Shaping the Future of GIS in Canada”**.

We welcome you to flip through the pages, interact with the mapping applications, and listen to some of the most influential GIS minds that have contributed to our industry.  We hope that as you reach the end of this journey you ask yourself – **“What am I giving back?”**

##### Why is our application cool?

Our application is cool because it’s out of the box and easy to use.  With the Briefing Book we were able to compile our story, provide the necessary narrative, and then beef it up with a variety of different ArcGIS web maps & apps that are interactive.

One of the web maps are Spider-Maps – these are cool, interactive web maps that are visually attractive.
