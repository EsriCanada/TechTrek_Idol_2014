Project Description: This application was built for the purpose of being able to get a personalized weather forecast for a trip with up to five different destinations in Canada.  Using an open source weather API (http://openweathermap.com/forecast) the 15 day forecast for each location is extracted and weather information along with the appropriate weather icon is displayed for the user. Each location is also geocoded on a map using the esri geocoding service within the application. 

How to Use: Enter in cities for your trip and select the dates when you will be arriving at those same locations using the built in calendar. As a limitation from the weather API, the dates have to be within a 16 day window from the current date. If a date is entered that is 16 days or more from the current date, the application defaults to a date 15 days from the current date. 
Once the cities and the dates have been entered, click the locate button. The cities will geocode on the map and the temperature information displays in the window. You can now plan your trip accordingly as you have the weather at each destination.
