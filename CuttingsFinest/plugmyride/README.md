## Buisness Case

Who would use Plug My Ride?  One of the main concerns that people often have about electric vehicles is how far can they drive on a single charge.  For most people that live and work in a small city and never drive long distances this problem does not apply.  However, for many people driving a fair distance to and from work or frequently traveling a long distance for recreation or vacation is not uncommon.   These individuals could benefit with a tool that could help them analyze their common traveling routes, and provide them a description of the feasibility of traveling these routes with an electric powered vehicle.  

Plug my ride could be tweaked to accommodate several use cases:

1. Electric car sales tool
	* Imagine this app being accessible by car dealership sales reps or even embedded in a automotive manufactures website.  With a powerful tool like Plug My Ride sales people would be able to help potential buyers envision their lifestyle in an electric car.

2. Generic Information Template
	* Municipalities and/or other government agencies could use such an application to help promote clean driving and other GREEN initiatives

3. Mobile Use
	* Provide the consumer a tool to help them find the charging station closest to their current location.  Better yet have Plug My Ride built into the vehicles technology package.
