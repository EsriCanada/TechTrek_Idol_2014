##Synopsis
The custom Operations Dashboard widget we created can be used to calculate how much energy would be generated by a road if it were completely replaced with interlocking, energy-producing, super cool solar panels!
##Instructions 
A sample Operations Dashboard View has been hosted on Cameron’s ArcGIS Online account (cmcevenue_support) and is open to the public (Operations Dashboard must be installed, if you do not have it it will be installed by clicking on the link).
To open the Operation View you must have an Organizational Account. We have experienced some odd behaviour accessing the app from Chrome so I would ask that you Paste the following URL in Internet Explorer to open the app.

The name of the Operations View is “Solar Roadways Operations Dashboard” and must be opened in the desktop Operations Dashboard application (custom widgets are not yet supported in the browser). The widget is hosted on the same AGOL account and is named “Solar Energy Calculator Operations Dashboard Widget” and can be added to any Operations View. The full solution for the widget has been provided.<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The inspiration for this application is from a real project, Solar Roadways, which is currently being developed and tested in Idaho. It aims at replacing impermeable surfaces such as roads with interlocking solar panels to create more reusable energy and lower dependency on fossil fuels.

##How was this awesome app made?
 
 The customized widget was created using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for WPF for Operations Dashboard. The sample widgets provided with the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for WPF were reviewed to achieve and understanding of developing custom add-ins for Operations Dashboard. In our sample application, we used a GTA road dataset retrieved from GeoBase.<br><br>
The app can be configured to use with any numeric field in a Feature Service, but is purposed to be used with a length field of a Simple Line Feature Service. In order to be used with more datasets we assumed a 2 lane width for all roads in our dataset as we wanted users without access to Lane data to be able to use the widget.
