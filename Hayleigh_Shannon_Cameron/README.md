##Synopsis

The custom Operations Dashboard widget we created can be used to calculate how much energy would be generated by a road if it were completely replaced with interlocking, energy-producing, super cool solar panels!

##Instructions 

A sample Operations Dashboard View has been hosted on Cameron’s ArcGIS Online account (cmcevenue_support) and is open to the public (Operations Dashboard must be installed, if you do not have it it will be installed by clicking on the link). 

To open the Operation View you must have an Organizational Account. We have experienced some odd behaviour accessing the app from Chrome so I would ask that you Paste the following URL in Internet Explorer to open the app.

https://www.arcgis.com/opsdashboard/OperationsDashboard.application?open=4080f0d6e6424460a4644f918b10d93f

 The name of the Operations View is “Solar Roadways Operations Dashboard” and must be opened in the desktop Operations Dashboard application (custom widgets are not yet supported in the browser). The widget is hosted on the same AGOL account and is named “Solar Energy Calculator Operations Dashboard Widget” and can be added to any Operations View. The full solution for the widget has been provided.

	The inspiration for this application is from a real project, Solar Roadways, which is currently being developed and tested in Idaho. It aims at replacing impermeable surfaces such as roads with interlocking solar panels to create more reusable energy and lower dependency on fossil fuels.

 ##How was this awesome app made?

	The customized widget was created using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for WPF for Operations Dashboard. The sample widgets provided with the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for WPF were reviewed to achieve and understanding of developing custom add-ins for Operations Dashboard. In our sample application, we used a GTA road dataset retrieved from GeoBase. The app can be configured to use with any numeric field in a Feature Service, but is purposed to be used with a length field of a Simple Line Feature Service.
	In order to be used with more datasets we assumed a 2 lane width for all roads in our dataset as we wanted users without access to Lane data to be able to use the widget.



#Benefits
-      ###Renewable energy

With 18.5% efficiency solar panels and an average of 4 peak daylight hours per day	
With a 230 Watt solar panel = ~ 21 billion kilowatt hours per year (in the USA)

Why waste so much space?
So much of the developed world is covered with asphalt and concrete (over 112,000 km2 in the United States alone - nearly 90,000 km2 after rooftops are accounted for)  for no purpose other than roads, sidewalks, parking, and roofs

-          ###Environmental impact:
Paved surfaces absorb energy and heat cities…for no reason. Let’s use this energy!
Less dependency on fossil fuels

-          Lowered costs for municipalities:
Roads free of snow/ice – not only convenient, but also a huge money-saver for municipalities that invest significant amounts in snow plough equipment and personnel
Sub-surface infrastructure: great home for power/data lines
Ability to treat/store/transport stormwater without the need for large ditches

-          LED lightening benefits are multifaceted:
Adaptable road lines according to traffic conditions
Safer nighttime driving
Improved traffic and road condition monitoring
Warnings for drivers about accidents/dangers/traffic
