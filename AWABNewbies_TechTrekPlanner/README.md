Our goal is to create a simple and sleek Tech Trek planner using the ArcGIS WebApp Builder. Some of the features we are planning include:

* Custom splash screen showing the convergence of all attendees arriving at the the Nottawasaga Inn
* Interactive conference level floorplan
   * Timeslider to navigate sessions throughout the day
* Activities widget

For Beta 2, we are looking at the following enhancements:

* 3D view of conference facilities
* Session/conference feedback mechanism
* Activity sign-up 
* Custom planner (requires attendee login)
* Routing
