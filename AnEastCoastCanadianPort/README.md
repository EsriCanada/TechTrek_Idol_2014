## The Purpose

The story map was created to generate publicity and interest in funding for a state-of-the-art interpretive centre on the Halifax waterfront. This centre would house the world's last Corvette - [HMCS Sackville](http://canadasnavalmemorial.ca/about-the-ship/) and deliver the story of Canada's role in the Battle. As a team we felt a story map would be an easy first way to introduce the public to the Battle of the Atlantic.
